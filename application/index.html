        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <img src="assets/03-night.jpg" alt="info-pic" class="info-pic">
        <p>We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral! As an interesting side
          note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead. Look, last night was a mistake. I'm sorry, guys.
          I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in.</p>
        <p>But I've never been to the moon! Yes! In your face, Gandhi! I can explain. It's very valuable. Bender?! You
          stole the
          atom. Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now:
          kill Flexo!</p>
        <p>I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no
          booze and
          only one hooker. Can I use the gun? Professor, make a woman out of me.</p>
        <p>Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony?
          THE BIG
          BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN! This is the worst part. The
          calm
          before the battle.</p>
        <p>Large bet on myself in round one. Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory. Ooh,
          name it
          after me! In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from
          perfectly healthy
          adults whom I killed for their stemcells.</p>
        <p>What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food.
          Interesting. No,
          wait, the other thing: tedious. This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't
          just have
          your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry!</p>
        <p>I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. I don't want to be rescued. Negative, bossy meat creature! Large
          bet
          on myself
          in round one.</p>
