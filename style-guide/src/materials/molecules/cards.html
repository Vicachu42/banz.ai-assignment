    <p>You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. This opera's as lousy

      <p>You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. This opera's as lousy
        as it is
        brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me
        feel
        angry! Actually, that's still true. Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. Calculon is
        gonna
        kill us and it's all everybody else's fault!</p>
