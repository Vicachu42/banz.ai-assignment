# banz.ai-assignment

Individual assignment in the Frontend UX/UI course. In this task we are supposed to build a website based on a Figma prototype created in a previous assignment. It must be built using HTML and Sass with a design system in Fabricator.

Link to [Figma prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/cU5yDHMd5fxz8mRfyp8pzw/Bonz.ai---Vic-Graf?node-id=14%3A21&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=14%3A15&starting-point-node-id=14%3A21)

**Note:** To get Fabricator to run on my computer, I had to install and run [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). This project is run on v12.22.7.
